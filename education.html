                                such as The Grunty Fen Run and The Round Norfolk Relay, organising the race and the canteen and keeping the runners motivated by participating in the events and distrubuting water and medals.
                            <br><br>2. Charity work - Crowning Around Bike Show raised money for East Anglian Air Ambulance, The Sick Children's trust and Littleport's Food Bank in 2019. We organised an RAF flypast featuring a Spitfire or Hurricane and this event
                            drawed in hundreds of bikers from far and wide. Planning had to start well in advance to secure road closures and logistics. The event featured live rock bands performing all day and into the night, along with outdoor bars, food stalls, sweet stalls,
                            and more. It was a long day for the staff, especially for me and a few other senior team members who were in charge. We worked from around 6am until closing at 2am, but every year it was absolutely worth it.

                            3. "The Outdoor Bar" - When working with The Crown Inn, we would do what we called "Outdoor Bars". This is basically where we take the pub to them! i.e They hired us to cater their weddings and other events.
