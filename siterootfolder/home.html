    <p class="homepara">Hello! Welcome to my Digital Portfolio. My name is Hayley Rutterford and I am currently a student at The College of West Anglia in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire.<br><br>
        This website will show you little snippets of my life and work over the last few years. It displays the growth and the progress that I have made, as well as the assignments I am most proud of.<br>
        Since September 2024, I have put time, energy, and effort into my tasks and I have learned more than ever because of it. Reflecting on my work has shown me how far I have come as both
        a student, and a person. My goal is to obtain the best grade I can possibly achieve, I can then progress on to the level 3 computing course so that I can be best prepared for job oppotunities after college.<br><br>
        Throughout this portfolio you will find pages about my education and professional achievements. My CV is also available for you to view or download at your convienience.<br><br>
        Thank you for visiting my digital portfolio!</p>
