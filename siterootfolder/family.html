Since moving we have closed all of our businesses, Matt has started a new job, more office based but still in the construction industry, about 15 minutes away from home and I have gone back to college. It's been a big change! We live with our two dogs Gotti & Hugo. </div>

                and he is good as gold, and no I'm not just being biased. He generally is a good kid. He's never been any trouble.<br><br> Harv turned 18 this year and currently works as a labourer for his stepdads landscaping business. He has just purchased his own car, so in his spare time if he isn't playing for his football team Soham Town Rangers, 
            he is buzzing around in his car, normally going to get some sort of food! This boy can eat!</p></div>

                        <div class="gottisdiv2 gottistext"><p>Gotti was a rescue dog, we were adament we were going to rescue a dog and not just buy a dog. After all, we wanted to give a dog a better life.
                            We searched for weeks and weeks for the right dog that suited us (rescue centres asre picky!) and as we called into a RSPCA one afternoon to go take a look at the dogs, all of them were jumping up, barking their heads off,
                            and there she was, our beautiful girl, just sat there looking at us, as quiet as a mouse with her one blue eye and one brown eye. We fell in love with her instantly and we hadn't seen her in there in the previous days so we quikcly went back to 
                            reception to enquire about her and asked to meet her if she hadn't already been reserved. She hadn't... luckily! And that was the beginning of Gotti becoming a spoilt princess. Gotti is cool, just wants to be left alone to sleep (apart from the odd demand 
                            of a belly rub here and there!) nothing fazes her and I can honestly say that a snail moves quicker than her! Bless her!<br><br>
                            Gotti used to come to work with us (see photo of her in van). When she was younger she had the most important job of supervising when we were doing jobs at home and she done a grand job of doing so. 5/5 stars for her!<br><br>
                            As time went on, she was unable to come to work due to age and her hips starting to play up so we had to start leaving her at home. So, we got her a little brother, Hugo! Our two dogs are like chalk and cheese. Gotti is calm and collected, Hugo is an absolute nutcase and certainly keeps you on your toes!
