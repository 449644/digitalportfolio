    <p class="hobbiespara">Welcome to my Hobbies page!<br><br>This is where you will learn about what I like to do in my spare time. Although I have a lot of hobbies, I rarely get to do any because if I am not at college or studying, I am renovating my recently purchased house to make it a home!</p>

            <div class="snowboardingdiv2 snowboardingtext"><p>I learned to snowboard in Milton Keynes on the dry slope at Xscape. It started when I had organised a week-long birthday trip for my stepson Harvey's 15th birthday and I had planned lots of surprises for him.
                We turned up and I told him that I had booked him in for a 1-1 private lesson to learn to snowboard, so he got dressed up and turned to us and asked why are we not dressed to do it. He wanted me and his dad to do it with him as a family. Well, I had not
                moved so fast in my life, I'd got changed into the appropiate gear in less that a minute! Matt on the other hand, took a bit longer! From there, it took us about a 6 months to pass all 6 levels before we were allowed on the big slope without a professional.<br><br>

                We decided for Harvey's 16th birthday to book to go to Bansko, Bulgaria where to took on the real mountains, we took my sister with us and she learned to snowboard too. We had a blast. All 4 of us got injuries on this trip, nothing major, and funnily enough mine was not from snowboarding! Mine was from a massage, whoops!<br><br>
                We enjoyed it so much, we returned to Bansko for Harvey's 18th birthday, to take on bigger slopes. I would recommend snowboarding to anyone!

                <div class="travellingdiv6 travellingtext"><p>I love travelling and seeing different cultures. I have currently only been to Turkey, Morocco, Bulgaria and regularly go to Spain.<br><br>
                My first ever holiday (as an adult anyway!) was to Turkey and we had a whole suite to ourselves with a swimming pool. We had a private beach which we had to take a private boat down the river to get too. It was lovely and peaceful. While we were there, we went and visited the caves and waterfalls on a private tour, the captain of the boat thought 
                it would be funny to put the nose of the boat where I was sitting underneath the waterfall, I got drenched! So we jumped in the sea and explored the caves. Unforetunatly, I got stung by a jellyfish that day, it wrapped itself round my foot and now I no longer go in the sea!<br><br>
            Morocco was absolutely breathtaking. The hotel we stayed in was phonomenal, we had a swim up to your room private pool, the food was amazing and it was mega quiet. The architecture and scenery when we went to the sooks in Marrackesh was beautiful, the colours of all of the tiles and the spices from the stalls was amazing. I dressed appropiately for their culture, but unforetunatly all the men there kept their eyes on me and made me feel really uncomfortable, I think it is because I have blonde hair and light eyes.
        Every country I have been too I have walked somewhere on my own, but I would have never dared here, I really did feel unsafe.<br><br>You can see for yourself from the photo of the mountain of Bulgaria just how beautiful it is. We did a couple of activities here, I went and visited some hot springs, I went on an Alpine rollercoaster that went through the forest down the mountain, we had to travel an hour to get to it! I also had a spa day! And as you can imagine, there was a lot of snowball fights!<br><br>
    Spain, Spain, Spain... before I returned to college, back when I was self-employed, I would work all throughout the year and take no holidays and have one massive holiday of 3-4 weeks over Christmas and New Year and go to my second home in Torrevieja, Spain and just relax..! When I say relax, I mean I would still walk 6 - 10 miles a day, but that doesn't matter because I wasn't working. I would go sit down in my favourite place at the end of the pier and people watch and watch the boats come in, load up the salt from 
the salt lakes and go again. On the walk home go have a menú del día. On New Years at midnight, you can stand on the promenade and the pier and watch fireworks go off in sync all along the coastline, they all pop Champagne, hug each other and start to party. Shortly after Christmas the Spanish throw a massive festival where they shut the entire town and they come together, make floats with people dressed in fancy costumes, throw sweets for the kids to catch, it truly is an amazing sight.</p></div>

                    When I say I can speak enough Spanish to get me by, what I mean by that is that I can order myself the essientials, like an ice cream everyday!
                    All jokes aside, I used to take daily lessons, but when I returned to college I stopped and started using an online app where I now do a 20 minute lesson
                    when I can to refresh my memory.

                <div class="fishingdiv1 fishingheading"><h2>Fishing</h2></div>
                <div class="fishingdiv2 fishingtext">I enjoy fishing as and when I can, but I mainly went through Covid as that was the only thing we were allowed to do. I used to go for 4 nights at a time, come home, restock up bits and pieces, have a proper shower and go back again for another 4 nights.
                    I had joined a syndicate lake where only members were allowed, and I was the only female, someone had to show the boys how to do it! The photo shows a carp I caught on 18/07/2020 at 3:36am weighing 20lbs 4oz! This was 1 of 2 carp caught in this session.<br><br>
                    Another reason I loved fishing is because of the nature surrounding it, I love nature and watching it and hearing it. I would quite often take a wander around the lake, looking into the fields. At night you would see all of the bats wake up and come to life. If it was raining, you would see all of the swallows swoop down to eat the nymphs 
                    coming up from the water. You would see Adders sliding through the water, all of it was just facinating, you really just were in your own little world. Silence.

When I went to the Imperial War Museam Duxford, I spent the whole day there, walking really slowly, taking lots and lots of photos. I even got a video of a Spitfire landing,

    <div class="bakingdiv5 bakingtext">I try to bake most weekends. I love the smell of homemade bread, I think it is one of the best smells in the world. Me and my sister Bryony are always competing when baking cakes
        and other sweet treats! I think I outdone it the year I made a 4 layer chocolate cake filled with chocolate and sweets inside though! Unfortunately, I forgot to get a photo of this as it was for someones birthday!<br><br>
        Pancakes are great, I love making them, they are super simple and fun. I wish I could make designs that you see people in videos do though!<br><br>
        We've done the sweet, now on to the best. The savoury! The trick is that you have to use meat from the butchers, not the supermarket! (Plus you're also helping out a small business!)
        I love making all sorts from cheese and bacon turnovers, scotch eggs and my favourite, and probably everyone elses too, sausage rolls! I make plain ones and then over the Christmas period
        I tend to throw in a bit of chorizo to mix it up a bit.
