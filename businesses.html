        <div class="wpsdiv2 wpstext">In establishing and co-managing a successful business, my responsibilities and accomplishments include providing timely and accurate quotes, 
            project planning to schedule work to meet agreed plans and costs, maintain administration, created business advertising building presence on social media, monitoring finances,
            access material costs to order best value and quality materials, and working as part of a team to deliver high quality service to uphold the reputation of business.<br><br>
            We made the decision to close Whitford Property Services due to me developing some health issues 10 years from starting the business. I have now got Tendonitis and Carpal Tunnel in both wrists,
            but mainly my dominant wrist which is my right wrist. My tendons are starting to deteriate on the outerside of my wrist. I spent over a year in and out of hospital for them to decide that I am too young to operate on.
            This can cause me an immense amount of pain sometimes.
